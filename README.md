this is a practice project in Google scholarship (Google Africa Devolopers - GADs) 
implementing - RecyclerView with ViewPager
             - GET and POST requests using retrofit2
             - little image processing using Picasso
             - Threads
             - TabLayouts
             
 the cool thing that, you submit the project through your application, so if your POST request not working you won't submit it, LOL.
  I have provided screenshots of the running application
